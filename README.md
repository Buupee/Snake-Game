# Snake Game 3D

🎮 *Snake Game 3D** – This is my first project developed using Unity. In this game, I learned the basics of character control, UI design, and 3D navigation in Unity.

## 📜 Project Description

"Snake Game 3D" is a modern take on the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake, collects food, and avoids obstacles. The game is created in 3D, adding depth and making the gameplay even more engaging.

### Key Features:
- **3D Control**: Implemented 3D movement for the snake.
- **Food Collection**: The snake grows longer with each item collected.
- **Score Counter**: Tracks points for collected items.
- **Boundaries and Collisions**: The player must avoid collisions with the boundaries and the snake’s own body.

##   What I Learned

Working on this project helped me learn:
- Object and character control in Unity.
- Camera setup and user interface (UI) creation.
- Basics of 3D graphics and physics in Unity.
- Writing scripts in C# for object control and game logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Unity**: For development and 3D visualization.
- **C#**: For game logic and character control.
- **MagicaVoxel**:Аor creating pixel 3D models

##  How to Play

1. Control the snake using the arrow keys (or specify the keys if different).
2. Collect food to grow the snake longer.
3. Avoid collisions with boundaries and your own body.

## 📝 Notes

- This project is my first work in Unity, and it helped me understand the basics of character control and 3D navigation.
