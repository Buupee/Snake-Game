# Snake Game 3D

"Snake Game 3D" â€“ This is my first project developed using Unity. In this game, I learned the basics of character control, UI design, and 3D navigation in Unity.

## Project Description

"Snake Game 3D" is a modern take on the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake, collects food, and avoids obstacles. The game is created in 3D, adding depth and making the gameplay even more engaging.

##   What I Learned

Working on this project helped me learn:
- Object and character control in Unity.
- Camera setup and user interface (UI) creation.
- Basics of 3D graphics and physics in Unity.
- Writing scripts in C# for object control and game logic.

## Technologies

- **Unity**: For development and 3D visualization.
- **C#**: For game logic and character control.
- **MagicaVoxel**: For creating pixel 3D models.

##  How to Play

- Control the snake using the arrow keys or WASD.
- Collect food to grow the snake longer.
- Avoid collisions with boundaries and your own body.

## Notes

This project is my first work in Unity, and it helped me understand the basics of character control and 3D navigation.
